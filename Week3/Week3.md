* ### Day 3: [Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/explore/other/card/30-day-leetcoding-challenge/530/week-3/3302/)
This question can be solved using the idea of finding the number of disjoint sets, you keep looking for any island (1) that you call DFS on to mark all its blocks as visited (convert them to 0).

* ### Day 4: [Minimum Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/explore/other/card/30-day-leetcoding-challenge/530/week-3/3303/)
This question can be solved using two approaches, the first is using Dijkstra to find the path with minimum sum from cell (0,0) until cell (m,n). The second one is to use a 2D array, loop over all cells and choose the minimum path for each one of them from the 2 allowed (top, or left), then the result would be inside the right bottom corner of your array.
