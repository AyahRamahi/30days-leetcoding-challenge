# Week 2

* ### Day 1: [Check If It Is a Straight Line](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/may-leetcoding-challenge/535/week-2-may-8th-may-14th/3323/)
Create the line equation which is `y = m * (x - x1) + y1`, where m is the slope, and (x1,y1) is a point on this line. The slope is `(y2-y1)/(x2-x1)` which you can calculate using the first two points you have. After that, just check that each point applies to this equation, and return false if not.
