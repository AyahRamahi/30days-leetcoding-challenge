# Week 2

* ### Day 1: [Mddle of the Linked List](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/30-day-leetcoding-challenge/529/week-2/3290/)
If you use 2 pointers one slow and one fast. The slow one moves 1 step at a time, but the fast moves 2 steps at a time, when the slow one reaches the middle the fast one would be at the end. When the fast pointer reaches the end, you know that the slow pointer is at the middle.
